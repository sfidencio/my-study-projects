## 🏉 What is Scrum?

Scrum is an agile framework for software development focused on fast delivery, collaboration, and continuous improvement.

> 💡 **TIP:** Scrum is not a rigid methodology, but a set of adaptable best practices!

---

## 👥 Scrum Roles

- **Product Owner (PO):** Responsible for the backlog and priorities.
- **Scrum Master:** Facilitates the process, removes impediments.
- **Dev Team:** Multidisciplinary team that delivers the product.

> 💡 **TIP:** Everyone has a voice in ceremonies, but each role has clear responsibilities!

---

## 📦 Scrum Artifacts

- **Product Backlog:** Prioritized list of everything to be done.
- **Sprint Backlog:** Items selected for the current Sprint.
- **Increment:** The working product at the end of the Sprint.

> 💡 **TIP:** Keep the backlog always updated and visible!

---

## 🗓️ Scrum Events

- **Sprint:** Work cycle (1-4 weeks).
- **Sprint Planning:** Sprint planning.
- **Daily Scrum:** 15-minute daily meeting.
- **Sprint Review:** Demonstration of what was delivered.
- **Sprint Retrospective:** Reflection on the process.

> 💡 **TIP:** Use ceremonies to align expectations and improve the team!

## 🧩 Key Scrum Terms

- **Story Points:** Effort points assigned to each backlog item to estimate complexity and work.
  > 💡 **TIP:** They do not represent hours, but relative difficulty!
- **Velocity:** Team speed, measured by the sum of story points delivered in each sprint.
- **Deadline:** Due date for a feature or project.
  > ⚠️ **Attention:** Scrum prioritizes incremental deliveries, but deadlines may exist due to external demands.
- **Definition of Done (DoD):** Clear criteria to consider an item truly done (e.g., tested, documented, reviewed).
- **Definition of Ready (DoR):** Criteria for an item to be ready to be pulled into the sprint (e.g., well described, estimated, unblocked).
- **Burndown Chart:** Chart showing sprint progress, visualizing remaining work over time.
- **Impediment:** Any obstacle blocking team progress.
  > 💡 **TIP:** Communicate impediments immediately to the Scrum Master!
- **Refinement (Grooming):** Session to detail, estimate, and split backlog items.
- **Sprint Goal:** Main objective of the sprint, aligning the team around a clear delivery.
- **Capacity:** Team capacity for the sprint, considering vacations, holidays, and availability.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Acceptance criteria for each item, ensuring what was requested will be delivered correctly.
- **Planning Poker:** Collaborative technique to estimate story points using cards.
- **Timebox:** Fixed time limit for events and activities (e.g., daily = 15min).
- **Increment:** Sum of all items delivered and ready at the end of the sprint.

## 🔄 Workflow

1. PO prioritizes the Product Backlog.
2. Team selects items for the Sprint (considering DoR, capacity, and story points).
3. Development during the Sprint, tracking the burndown.
4. Delivery of the Increment (following DoD and acceptance criteria).
5. Feedback, review, retrospective, and continuous improvement.
