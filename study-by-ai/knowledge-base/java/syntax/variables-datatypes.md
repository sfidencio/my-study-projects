# 📝 Variables & Data Types

## 📦 Variables
Variables are used to store data that can be manipulated or referenced in a program. In programming languages, variables usually have a name and an associated type.

### Examples:
```java
// Declaration of variables in Java
String name = "John"; // String
int age = 30;         // Integer number
boolean active = true; // Boolean
```

## 🔢 Data Types
Data types define the kind of value a variable can store. Here are some common types:

### 🔑 Primitive Types:
1. **📝 String**: Represents text.
   ```java
   String text = "Hello, world!";
   ```
2. **🔢 int**: Represents integer numbers.
   ```java
   int number = 42;
   ```
3. **💲 double**: Represents floating-point numbers.
   ```java
   double price = 19.99;
   ```
4. **✅ boolean**: Represents logical values (true or false).
   ```java
   boolean active = true;
   ```
5. **🔤 char**: Represents a single character.
   ```java
   char initial = 'J';
   ```

### 🧩 Complex Types:
1. **🛠️ Object**: Represents an instance of a class.
   ```java
   class Person {
       String name;
       int age;
   }
   Person person = new Person();
   person.name = "John";
   person.age = 30;
   ```
2. **📋 Array**: Represents an ordered list of values.
   ```java
   int[] list = {1, 2, 3, 4};
   ```

## 💡 Tips:
- Use `final` to declare constants.
- Always initialize variables before using them.
- Prefer primitive types to save memory unless you need objects.

## 🏁 Conclusion
Understanding variables and data types is essential for writing efficient and error-free code. Practice declaring variables and experimenting with different data types!
