## 🧠 Go Developer Mindset

Beyond technical skills, developing a mindset aligned with Go philosophy is essential.

- [ ] **Simplicity over Complexity**
  - Value straightforward solutions instead of excessive abstractions

- [ ] **Pragmatism**
  - Focus on code that works, is readable, and can be maintained by others

- [ ] **Clarity over Elegance**
  - Prefer explicit code that clearly communicates intent

- [ ] **Composition over Inheritance**
  - Build complex systems by composing smaller, well-defined parts

- [ ] **Concurrency as a Tool**
  - Understand when and how to effectively apply concurrency

- [ ] **Explicit Side Effects**
  - Make code side effects visible and predictable

- [ ] **Deliberate Optimization**
  - Write clear code first, optimize only when necessary and with metrics

- [ ] **Compatibility and Stability**
  - Value stable APIs and backward compatibility

- [ ] **Consistent Conventions** 
  - Follow Go community conventions for code and design

- [ ] **Collective Thinking**
  - Consider how code will be read and maintained by other developers
